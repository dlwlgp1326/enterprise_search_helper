# Internal Search Utilities

This Python module (`internal_search_utils.py`) provides a collection of common helper functions for interacting with our company's internal services, including database connections, API fetching, and authentication.

-----

## \#\# Overview

In a large enterprise environment, many services require repetitive boilerplate code to handle tasks like database connections, API calls, and logging. This module centralizes these common functions to improve code reusability and maintainability across different projects. It is designed to be a simple, plug-and-play solution for developers working within our internal infrastructure.

## \#\# Features

  * **Database Connection**: Simplified wrapper to connect to standard corporate databases.
  * **API Fetching**: Helper function to easily retrieve data from internal REST APIs.
  * **SSO Authentication**: Utility to validate internal Single Sign-On (SSO) tokens.
  * **Configuration Management**: Functions to read and parse standard JSON config files.
  * **Standardized Logging**: A custom logger setup for consistent logging formats.

## \#\# Usage

To use the utilities in your project, simply import the desired functions from the module.

### \#\#\# Example: Connecting to the Database and Fetching User Data

```python
import internal_search_utils as utils

# 1. Establish a connection to the primary database
db_conn = utils.get_database_connection("MAIN_DB_PROD")

if db_conn:
    print("Database connection successful.")

# 2. Fetch data for a specific user from the internal API
user_data = utils.fetch_user_data_from_api("USER-12345")
print(f"Fetched user info: {user_data}")

# 3. Validate an SSO token
is_valid = utils.check_sso_token_validity("dummy-sso-token-string")
if is_valid:
    print("SSO token is valid.")

```
